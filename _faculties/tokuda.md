Dr. Tokuda is a computer scientist specialized in development and clinical application of novel software and robotics technologies for image-guided interventions, particularly MRI-guided interventions. At Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital, he developed guidance software that enables transperinal targeted prostate biopsy under direct MRI-guidance. The software has been used in more than 400 clinical cases. I also co-developed a remotely-controlled motorized needle guide manipulators with his collaborators. The device was used in 30 clinical cases as of today. 

Through his experience in research and development of software and hardware systems, he has learned that seamless data sharing between hardware and software components (e.g. devices, sensors, scanners, and software) is crucial, and there was a strong demand for a standardized interface to achieve it. He extended the interface software developed for his research, and published as free open-source software named OpenIGTLink. OpenIGTLink is supported by a number of open-source and commercial software packages, and can be found in more than 300 publications (Google Scholar, searched on May 18, 2017). OpenIGTLink has created an ecosystem for sharing software resources in the community. Currently I am leading an NIH R01 project to further extend the OpenIGTLink.
