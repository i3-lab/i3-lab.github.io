Interactive Image-guided Interventions Laboratory (I3 Lab) is a research group specialized
in the development and clinical application of software and robotics technologies.
Our mission is to provide tools and infrastructures for closed-loop interventions,
where the delivery of treatment is captured by means of intraoperative imaging and
fed back to the physician immediately. This closed-loop process would allow the physician
to control the treatment more interactively and adaptively.  The tools and infrastructures
developed and tested in our group are shared with other groups in the research community.

Our strength is its proximity to the clinical facilities. I3 Lab is a part of
NIH-funded National Center for Image Guided Therapy (NCIGT) at Department of Radiology,
Brigham and Women's Hospital, which provides access to a wide variety of state-of-the-art
clinical facilities including Advanced Multimodality Image Guided Operation (AMIGO) Suite.
The laboratory is located on the main campus of Brigham and Women's Hospital,
allowing close collaborations with clinicians, technologists,  nurses, and other clinical staffs.
